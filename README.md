Puzlet
======

Puzlet is about [Aha! moments](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eureka_effect) in 
science, technology, mathematics and engineering.
It is open-source. It uses standard web technologies.

In essence, Puzlet is a collection of GIT repositories, interconnected by shared code.
Each repository defines a **blab** (blab = web + laboratory, like blog = web + log). 
A blab is a short(ish) article defined with HTML, CSS and JavaScript (or CoffeeScript). 

Blabs may share code, for instance, to solve differential equations or 
draw patterns of springs and masses---or for any other reason that makes development easier or more efficient.
In particular, a topic may be split into multiple blabs according to discipline.

A blab may be both explanatory and exploratory. 
That is, it may both show how something works (perhaps with an animation) 
and allow the user to interact with the programming in the way of Matlab, Octave, Python, etc.
